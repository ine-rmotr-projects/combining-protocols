### [Advanced Python: Iterators, Generators and Decorators](https://my.ine.com/course/advanced-python-iterators-generators-and-decorators/76ef3341-6f66-4a9d-9ffa-a4c950a234ae)

# Combining protocols

In this final project, we will specify two tasks that will utilize two or more of the overall techniques of protocols discussed in this course.

For these task, we use some data inside an SQLite database that has been used in some other INE courses as well.  The requirement is, of necessity, slightly forced, since a better solution than you will provide is simply "use the excellent DB-API and `sqlite3` driver."  However, in order to simulate the need from more from-scratch construction, suppose that you can **only** access the data via the following class.

Start with the Notebook `Project.ipynb`, and best of luck!
